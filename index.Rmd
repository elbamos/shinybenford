This was created as a simple demonstration project, to show a group of forensic accountants the benefits to using statistical software more advanced than the Excel macros they had been working with.

Benford's Law posits that in any set of real-world numbers, the most significant digits are distributed according to $P(d) = log_{10}(1 + 1/d)$.

```{r warning=F,error=F,method=F,echo=F}
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(wesanderson)
library(scales)
library(grid)
colors_discrete <- function(x) wes_palette("Darjeeling", n = x)
colors_divergent_discrete <- grDevices::colorRampPalette(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "Spectral"))
colors_continuous <-  function(x) wes_palette(name= "Zissou",n = x, type= "continuous")
nacol <- colors_discrete(4)[4]

theme_set(
	theme_bw() %+replace%
		#	theme_fivethirtyeight() +
		theme(#legend.position="bottom",
			legend.key.size=unit(4,"mm"),
			legend.title=element_text(size=rel(0.8), face = "bold"),
			legend.margin=unit(0,"cm"),
			legend.key.size=unit(0.5,"lines"),
			legend.text=element_text(size = unit(10, "points")),
			axis.title.y = element_text(angle=90),
			axis.text = element_text(size=rel(0.7)),
			plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0.5, 1, 0), "lines"),
			axis.title=element_text(size=rel(0.8),face="bold")
		)
)

data.frame(digit = factor(1:9), 
										probability = log10(1 + 1/1:9)) %>%
	ggplot( aes(x = digit, y = probability)) +
	geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
```

Benford's Law is often used in forensic accounting. A common use, for example, would be to chart the distribution for a general ledger or petty cash account. In many cases, investigators have found bulges deviating from the Benford Distribution just under some officer's spending authority limit.
